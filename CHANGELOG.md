## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-06

### Changed
- **Rewrote the bot to download and send real MP3 files** via `yt-dlp` + `ffmpeg` instead of posting YouTube links — no YouTube Data API key required anymore
- Playlist reading now uses `yt-dlp` flat extraction (`_get_playlist_videos`)
- Audio is downloaded as `bestaudio` and converted to 192 kbps MP3 (`_download_audio`), sent via `bot.send_audio`, then deleted after a successful send
- Renamed `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` → `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
- State is now stored per channel: `sent_videos_<name>.json` / `pinned_msgs_<name>.json`
- `requirements.txt` now pins `yt-dlp==2025.1.15`; dropped `google-api-python-client`

### Fixed
- **CI state persistence:** the workflow committed empty un-suffixed `sent_videos.json` / `pinned_msgs.json`, so real per-channel state was never saved and every run re-posted the whole playlist. Now force-adds `sent_videos_*.json` / `pinned_msgs_*.json`
- Removed the unused `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` secret from the workflow
- Deleted the empty legacy `sent_videos.json` / `pinned_msgs.json` from the repo

### Added
- `tests/` with `pytest` unit tests and `ruff` linting, wired into CI

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- Retry logic with exponential back-off for YouTube API and Telegram API calls (`RETRY_ATTEMPTS`, `RETRY_DELAY` env vars)
- Configurable delay between consecutive posts (`POST_DELAY` env var)
- Rotating file handler for `bot.log` (max 5 MB × 3 backups) alongside console logging
- `LOG_LEVEL` and `LOG_FILE` environment variables for runtime log configuration
- Startup config validation — fails fast with a clear error when required env vars are missing
- `SENT_VIDEOS_FILE` and `PINNED_MSGS_FILE` env vars to override default state file paths
- `Dockerfile` for containerised deployment (Python 3.12-slim, state persisted in `/app/data` volume)
- `docker-compose.yml` for one-command local and server deployment
- `requirements.txt` with pinned dependency versions
- Rewritten `README.md` — badges, architecture diagram, full configuration reference (EN + RU)

### Changed
- Logging format upgraded to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | LEVEL | module | message`
- `datetime.utcnow()` replaced with timezone-aware `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
- YouTube page fetches extracted to a dedicated `_fetch_page()` function (retried independently)
- Telegram send/pin/unpin extracted to `_send_message()`, `_pin_message()`, `_unpin_message()` (each retried independently)
- Progress counter added to per-video log lines: `[1/5] Posted: …`
